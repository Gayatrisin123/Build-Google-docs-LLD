This project is a simple document editor system designed using Low-Level Design (LLD) principles and implemented in C++.
It allows users to create documents consisting of text, images, line breaks, and tab spaces, and supports saving the final output using different storage mechanisms.

The design strictly follows SOLID principles, making the system modular, extensible, and easy to maintain.
